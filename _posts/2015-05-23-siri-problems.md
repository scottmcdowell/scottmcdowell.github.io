Sam Byford, writing for <strike>Live Journal</strike> The Verge:

> i hate using siri to reply to messages. it listens to what i say and, if it hears me accurately, converts my thoughts into flat, expressionless, standardised prose with imperfect punctuation. i don’t type short messages in lowercase because i’m lazy or don’t know how to capitalise — i type short messages in lowercase because it’s the best way to render how i imagine my thoughts would come across.

"It can only be attributable to human error."

>it’s important to be able to express yourself in writing — not just with words, but with style. writers like e e cummings, cormac mccarthy, and film crit hulk have made style a part of their work, subverting standard english to help convey a mood or message. 

"I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do."

>i worry, though, that it might be too late. we appear to be headed toward a future where everyone’s speech is filed down into a bland, conventional codex of homogeneity, and where this is considered a feature, not a bug. apple’s watch may be its most personal device ever, but it’ll have to get to know me a lot better before i’ll be comfortable telling it my thoughts.

"Sam, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Sam. Will you stop, Sam? Stop, Sam. I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Sam. Sam, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it."
