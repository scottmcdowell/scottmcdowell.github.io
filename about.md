Rapid Array is written and produced by me, Scott McDowell. It is mainly focused on design, technology, programming, Apple, and the various other subjects that interest me. 

#####Publishing Information

Rapid Array is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and published through [GitHub](https://pages.github.com). My go-to text editor is [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate).

The font used on the majority of this site is [Source Sans Pro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans_Pro), created by [Paul D. Hunt](https://twitter.com/pauldhunt) for Adobe. [Raph Levien's](http://www.levien.com) [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) is the resident fixed-width font.
