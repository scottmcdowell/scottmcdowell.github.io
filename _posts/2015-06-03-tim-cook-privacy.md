Tim Cook addressing the [Electronic Privacy Information Center](https://epic.org/june1/):

>I’m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information [...] They’re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that’s wrong. And it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.

Matthew Panzarino commenting:

>I’m honestly surprised that it took this long for Apple to begin leveraging this particular ‘fine print’ point of how it does business.

I agree, but I think it's more than that. One of the most admirable things about Tim Cook's Apple is its transparency and hard line on certain issues: workplace equality, environmental issues, accessibility, and privacy. While these trait are certainly marketable (in my mind, at least), I don't think Cook places a premium on them for leverage, or marketability, and certainly not ROI. Tim Cook pursues them because he thinks it's the right thing to do.

In [his own words](http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s), "If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock."
