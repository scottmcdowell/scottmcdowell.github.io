>Traditional Swiss luxury watch manufacturers have dismissed Apple’s timepiece as too common and cheap to be luxury. When it was launched, then Tag Heuer boss Stéphane Linder sniffed: ‘Luxury is about being unique and rare. At $350, it looks more mass market.’ Newson retorts: ‘There are a lot of Louis Vuitton bags out there. I think at one point every 1.5 Japanese woman had a Louis Vuitton bag. But it still qualifies as a luxury object. It’s about the quality and integrity of the product.’

Interesting profile from the London Evening Standard.
