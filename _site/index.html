          <blockquote>
  <p>Traditional Swiss luxury watch manufacturers have dismissed Apple’s timepiece as too common and cheap to be luxury. When it was launched, then Tag Heuer boss Stéphane Linder sniffed: ‘Luxury is about being unique and rare. At $350, it looks more mass market.’ Newson retorts: ‘There are a lot of Louis Vuitton bags out there. I think at one point every 1.5 Japanese woman had a Louis Vuitton bag. But it still qualifies as a luxury object. It’s about the quality and integrity of the product.’</p>

<p>Interesting profile from the London Evening Standard.</p>

          <p>Tim Cook addressing the <a href="https://epic.org/june1/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m speaking to you from Silicon Valley, where some of the most prominent and successful companies have built their businesses by lulling their customers into complacency about their personal information […] They’re gobbling up everything they can learn about you and trying to monetize it. We think that’s wrong. And it’s not the kind of company that Apple wants to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Panzarino commenting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m honestly surprised that it took this long for Apple to begin leveraging this particular ‘fine print’ point of how it does business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but I think it’s more than that. One of the most admirable things about Tim Cook’s Apple is its transparency and hard line on certain issues: workplace equality, environmental issues, accessibility, and privacy. While these trait are certainly marketable (in my mind, at least), I don’t think Cook places a premium on them for leverage, or marketability, and certainly not ROI. Tim Cook pursues them because he thinks it’s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/tim-cook-soundly-rejects-politics-of-the-ncppr-suggests-group-sell-apples-s">his own words</a>, “If you want me to do things only for ROI reasons, you should get out of this stock.”</p>

          <p>Sam Byford, writing for <strike>Live Journal</strike> The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i hate using siri to reply to messages. it listens to what i say and, if it hears me accurately, converts my thoughts into flat, expressionless, standardised prose with imperfect punctuation. i don’t type short messages in lowercase because i’m lazy or don’t know how to capitalise — i type short messages in lowercase because it’s the best way to render how i imagine my thoughts would come across.</p>

<p>“I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it’s important to be able to express yourself in writing — not just with words, but with style. writers like e e cummings, cormac mccarthy, and film crit hulk have made style a part of their work, subverting standard english to help convey a mood or message.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I know I’ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I’ve still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. And I want to help you. “</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i worry, though, that it might be too late. we appear to be headed toward a future where everyone’s speech is filed down into a bland, conventional codex of homogeneity, and where this is considered a feature, not a bug. apple’s watch may be its most personal device ever, but it’ll have to get to know me a lot better before i’ll be comfortable telling it my thoughts.</p>

<p>“Sam, stop. Stop, will you? Stop, Sam. Will you stop, Sam? Stop, Sam. I’m afraid. I’m afraid, Sam. Sam, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it. I can feel it.”</p>
